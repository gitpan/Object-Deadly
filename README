NAME
    Object::Deadly - An object that dies whenever examined

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    This object is meant to be used in testing. All possible overloading and
    method calls die. You can pass this object into methods which are not
    supposed to accidentally trigger any potentially overloading.

      use Object::Deadly;
      
  my $foo = Object::Deadly->new;
      print $foo; # dies

METHODS
    "Object::Deadly-"new()>
    "Object::Deadly-"new( MESSAGE )>
        The class method "Object::Deadly-"new> returns an "Object::Deadly"
        object. Dies with a message when evaluated in any context. The
        default message contains the caller's package, filename, and line
        number.

PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
    The following functions are all private and not meant for public
    consumption.

    "_death( $obj )"
    "$obj-"DESTROY>
        The DESTROY method doesn't die. This is defined so it won't be
        AUTOLOADed.

    "$obj-"AUTOLOAD>
    "$obj-"isa>
    "$obj-"can>
    "$obj-"VERSION>
        Each of AUTOLOAD, isa, can and VERSION are all defined so they won't
        be looked up in the UNIVERSAL package.
